> **Note on Project Evolution**: This repository documents my learning journey in computational linguistics. The `z_archive/` folder contains my initial exploratory work (Phase 1: broad ambiguity analysis). Based on that learning, I refocused the project on a more specific, achievable research question about contested political terms. This evolution reflects genuine research practiceâ€”refining questions based on data constraints and conceptual clarity.

### Project Evolution

### Phase 1: Exploratory Work (Archived)
**Goal**: Broad ambiguity analysis across Colombian legal decrees  
**What I learned**: 
- Data collection challenges (PDF extraction, OCR)
- spaCy basics for Spanish NLP
- Scope needed refinement for pre-MA work

**Key takeaway**: Research questions must match available data and timeline.

### Phase 2: Focused Analysis (Current)
**Goal**: Semantic framing of contested terms in Colombian political discourse
