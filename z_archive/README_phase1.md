# Phase 1: Exploratory Ambiguity Analysis

## Original Goal
Analyze linguistic ambiguity patterns across Colombian legal decrees using:
- Modal verb detection
- Subjunctive mood analysis
- Dependency parsing

## What I Built
- PDF text extraction pipeline (pdfplumber + OCR fallback)
- Basic text cleaning scripts
- spaCy Spanish NLP setup
- Preliminary data collection (5 decrees)

## What I Learned
1. **Data challenges**: PDF extraction requires multiple approaches
2. **Scope reality**: Comprehensive ambiguity analysis needs more resources
3. **Research focus**: Need specific question, not broad exploration
4. **Methods understanding**: Gained foundation in NLP basics

## Why I Refocused
While this exploratory work was valuable for learning, I realized:
- Available data (5 decrees) insufficient for broad corpus claims
- Research question too general for pre-MA timeline
- More meaningful to focus on specific linguistic phenomenon

This led to Phase 2: focused analysis of contested term semantics.

## Code Preserved Here
Extraction and preprocessing scripts preserved as reference for Phase 2.
